### Note: if nothing loads that is because the IMDB server I'm parsing the data from allows only 100 messages per day.

# MovieGuide is a movie search app I created.
In this app I used:
- MVVM architecture, dependency injection by Koin.
- Retrofit to get data from server
- Coil to load images
- Room for saving movies to database

I made a wishlist, so you can save movies to the database.
